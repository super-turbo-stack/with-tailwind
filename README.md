# Create Super Turbo Theming Starter

Welcome to the official starter repository for the **Create Super Turbo** CLI tool. This starter sets up a streamlined development environment using React, Next.js, and Express, all configured with theming support using ShadCN's `theme-provider`.

## What's Inside?

This repository is generated by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-super-turbo@latest -y --pnpm
```

It includes:

- **React**, **Next.js**, and **Express** apps pre-configured with essential dependencies.
- **Theming via ShadCN**'s `theme-provider` component, allowing you to easily manage dark mode and light mode using class selectors.
- TailwindCSS configuration that directly handles dark mode, replacing the `prefers-color-scheme` media query with a class-based approach for more control.
- A single `theme-provider` component, which exports:
  - `ThemeProvider` for React apps
  - `NextThemeProvider` for Next.js apps
  - `useTheme` hook to manage theme switching.

You can extend or modify the code to suit your projectâ€™s needs. Feel free to split the theme providers for React and Next.js into separate components, if necessary.

## How to Use

To use this starter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-super-turbo@latest -y --pnpm
```

Then, reference the changes made in this repository to set up theming, or simply clone the repository to get started right away.
